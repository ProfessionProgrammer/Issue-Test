This is the test project added to addressed the issue related to the primefaces-8.0 .

In test.xhtml file if we remove the maxdate attribute form the <p:datepicker> component then it is working fine but with that attribute it is not working file.

I checked the dataType of maxDate variable with (java.util.Date, java.time.LocalDateTime)


Thank you.
